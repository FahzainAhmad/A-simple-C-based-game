A basic game for the C console.

This is an easy game with very basic mechanics. The main objective of this game is to collect as many "$"s as possible. The player can move TOP, LEFT, RIGHT, and BOTTOM using the WASD format as well as "/" to EXIT. As it renders directly on the console, this game does not require any graphics libraries. A player can enter multiple commands at once in order to execute them in order. For example, a player can write "w" to make the character go UP, but a player can also write a whole string like "wasd," which will make the player go UP, LEFT, BOTTOM, and RIGHT.

You can use, share, and modify the code as you wish. You can add me in credits by adding
